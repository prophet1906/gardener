Informally, an **algorithm** is any well-defined computational procedure that takes some value, or set of values, as **input** and produces some value, or set of values, as **output**. An algorithm is thus a sequence of computational steps that transform the input into the output.

We can also view an algorithm as a tool for solving a well-specified **computational problem**. The statement of the problem specifies in general terms the desired input/output relationship. The algorithm describes a specific computational procedure for achieving that input/output relationship.

Algorithms is a very broad topic and cannot be covered in individual note, I would recommend using **#algorithm** tag to find all notes related to algorithms. I would also recommend going through the reading material mentioned below.
