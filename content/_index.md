title: Shubham's Digital Garden🪴
---

Hi, there 👋. My name is Shubham. I am skilled at solving real world problems with available resources. I am fortunate enough to work alongside so many extraordinary people and learn from them. I set aside a few minutes every day to share what I'm learning here in my digital garden. You can find more about me [[About Me|here]].

In this garden 🏡, I publish my learning journey, and projects as [obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) notes that I will continue to maintain. There is no perfect end state, and it will always be a work in progress!
